## 1. Problem Statement

### Current Reality

The app treats all element types (classes, enums, slots, variables) as **nodes** with inconsistent relationship handling:

**The Mish-Mash**:
- Classes ARE directly related to Slots (via `slots` arrays and `slot_usage`)
- BUT Classes are NOT directly related to other Classes/Enums—those relationships are **mediated by slots**
- The UI **hides slot mediation**, showing `Specimen → SpecimenTypeEnum` as a direct link
- **Result**: Slots function as both nodes (clickable, have details) AND invisible edges (class→range relationships hide them)

**Problems**:
- Makes it hard for users to understand class-slot-range relationships
- Leads to weirdness in data structures and unneeded complexity in figuring out class-range relationships

### Why Change?

1. **Accurate slot inheritance**: Different classes using same slot definition should have different edge instances
2. **Preparation for Types**: Need Range abstraction (Class | Enum | Type) before importing linkml:types
3. **Simplified relationship logic**: Explicit slot edges should make hover/link logic simpler

---

## 2. Proposed Architecture

### Core Concept

**Graph model with slots serving dual roles**:
- **Slots as nodes**: SlotElement definitions browsable in optional middle panel (~170 in BDCHM including global and attributes)
- **Slots as edges**: SlotEdge instances connecting Class → Range, referencing slot definitions

### Graph Structure

**Nodes**:
- **Classes**: Entity, Specimen, Material, etc.
- **Enums**: SpecimenTypeEnum, AnalyteTypeEnum, etc.
- **Slots**: All slot definitions (~170 in BDCHM), browsable in middle panel only
- **Types** (to be imported): Primitives (string, integer) and custom types from linkml:types
- **Variables**: No longer appear as panel sections, only in detail boxes and relationship hovers

**Edges**:
- **InheritanceEdge**: is-a/inherits-from edges for class inheritance
- **MapsToEdge**: Variable → Class associations
- **ClassToSlot**: Class → Slot (rather than storing slots as class properties)
- **SlotToRange**: Slot → Range
- **ClassToRange**: Direct edges formed from slots
  - Properties: slot name, required, multivalued, description, inherited_from, overrides
  - References SlotElement definition (can look up from name)
  - Multiple edges can reference same SlotElement (e.g., inherited with overrides)
  - **Replaces**: ClassSlot instances (more edges than slot definitions)

**Slot Edge Details**:
- Slots exist as nodes with simple edges: class → slot, slot → range
- Slots (slot nodes) are referenced in edges between classes and ranges. There are more edges than slots.
- An edge between a class and, say, an enum for an inherited slot:
  - Goes from the subclass to the enum
  - Holds a reference to (and can display properties of) the slot node it inherited
  - Also knows/displays the ancestor it inherited from
- If the subclass specifies a slot_usage, the edge shows properties of the slot_usage rather than of the referenced slot node

**Range Abstraction**:
- **Range** (abstract base class or interface)
  - ClassElement extends Range
  - EnumElement extends Range
  - TypeElement extends Range (new)
- Allows uniform handling of slot range targets

### UI Layout (Three-Panel Design)

**Left Panel** (always visible):
- Classes only (tree hierarchy)
- NOT shown as ranges—represents schema structure

**Middle Panel** (toggleable by clicking heading):
- **Default**: Hidden
- **Toggle**: Panel title "Show Slots" / "Hide Slots"
- **Content**: Slot browser showing all SlotElement definitions
- **Purpose**: Navigable nodes for exploration - clicking a slot shows which classes use it, what its range is
- **Link rendering**: When visible, show links from class → slot → range (two-step)

**Right Panel**:
- **Ranges** section: Classes, Enums, Types as range targets
- **Panel title**: "Ranges: [C] [E] [T]" (separate sections for each type)
- **Classes in both panels**: Classes appear in left panel (structure) and right panel (as ranges)

**Detail Boxes**:
- Slots appear as properties with clickable/hoverable ranges
- Range values clearly shown as connected nodes
- Slot metadata visible (required, multivalued, inherited_from)

### Open Questions

**High Priority** (must answer before implementing):

1. **Graphology + OOP Architecture**: How to combine graphology graph with OOP classes?

   **Context**: Graphology stores properties as primitives (strings, numbers), not JS/TS objects

   **Option A - Graph stores IDs only**:
   - Graphology nodes/edges contain only IDs
   - OOP instances (ClassElement, SlotEdge, etc.) stored separately
   - Query flow: graphology query → get IDs → lookup instances → generate UI data
   - Challenge: Can't filter by properties in graph queries

   **Option B - Graph stores all properties**:
   - All properties duplicated as graphology node/edge attributes
   - Query using properties as criteria
   - Optional: Keep OOP instances for methods, or eliminate them entirely

   **Option C - Hybrid**:
   - Some properties in graph (for queries), some in OOP instances
   - Awkward but workable

   **Benefits of graphology adoption**:
   - Collections simplify to getLabel, getDefaultExpansion
   - Replace methods like getUsedByClasses with graphology queries
   - May not need artificial root node

   **Decision timing**: Experiment during Stage 2 (Step 0: Define DataService/model interfaces) to see what works best for our query patterns

**Medium Priority** (decide during implementation):

2. **LinkML documentation features**: What to include from generated docs?

   **From BDCHM Study** (see PROGRESS.md Phase 14):
   - **Terminology**: "Direct slots" vs "Induced slots" (direct = defined on class, induced = flattened including inherited)
   - **Inheritance visualization**: Local neighborhood Mermaid diagrams showing class relationships
   - **Attribute grouping**: Separate display of inherited vs direct attributes
   - **Cardinality notation**: "0..1" (optional), "1" (required), "*" or "0..*" (multivalued)
   - **Slot constraints**: Range constraints, required/multivalued flags
   - **Relationship patterns**: Self-referential, cross-class, activity relationships, mutual exclusivity
   - **Raw YAML display**: Optional toggle to show raw schema definitions
   - **Clickable navigation**: Between related classes, enums, slots

3. **Unused slot visualization**: How to distinguish unused SlotElement definitions from active SlotEdge instances?
   - Suggestion: Lower opacity for unused slots (we might not have unused slots in bdchm)

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites

Before starting the refactor, complete UI/model separation from Phase 12:

1. ✅ **Rename type-based identifiers to section-based terminology**
   - ✅ `leftPanelTypes`/`rightPanelTypes` → `leftSections`/`rightSections`
   - ✅ `LinkTooltipData.sourceType`/`targetType` → `sourceSection`/`targetSection`
   - ✅ `RelationshipData.itemType` → `itemSection`
   - ✅ All relationship fields use "section" terminology

2. ✅ **Replace type union literals with string in UI layer**
   - ✅ Remove `'class' | 'enum' | 'slot' | 'variable'` hardcoded unions
   - ✅ Use generic `string` type in UI components and hooks
   - ✅ UI layer no longer has hardcoded knowledge of model types

**Result**: UI layer depends only on DataService contract. Model layer can now be refactored without touching UI.

### Stage 1: Infrastructure Setup & Interface Definition

**Goal**: Set up infrastructure to replace model layer and define new edge-based interfaces without touching UI

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All 4 steps done (see PROGRESS.md Phase 16)

**Steps**:

1. ✅ **Create Element.ts infrastructure**
   - Rename `src/models/Element.ts` → `src/models/ElementPreRefactor.ts`
   - Create new `src/models/Element.ts` with explicit re-exports as refactor roadmap
   - Verify no UI changes needed, all tests pass

2. ✅ **Define new edge-based interfaces** (based on [UI_REFACTOR.md](UI_REFACTOR.md))
   - Add to `src/models/Element.ts`:
     ```typescript
     // New interfaces for Slots-as-Edges
     export interface ItemInfo {
       id: string;
       displayName: string;
       typeDisplayName: string;  // "Class", "Enum", "Slot", "Variable"
       color: string;
     }

     export interface EdgeInfo {
       edgeType: 'inheritance' | 'property' | 'variable_mapping';
       otherItem: ItemInfo;
       label?: string;
       inheritedFrom?: string;  // Property edges only
     }

     export interface LinkPair {
       sourceId: string;
       targetId: string;
       sourceColor: string;
       targetColor: string;
       label?: string;
     }

     export interface RelationshipData {
       thisItem: ItemInfo;
       outgoing: EdgeInfo[];
       incoming: EdgeInfo[];
     }
     ```

3. ✅ **Add stub DataService methods**
   - Added to `src/services/DataService.ts`:
     - `getAllPairs(): LinkPair[]` - Returns empty array (stub)
     - `getRelationshipsNew(itemId): RelationshipData | null` - Returns null (stub)
   - Kept old methods for backward compatibility (marked deprecated)

4. ✅ **Variable field rename** (small cleanup bundled with Stage 1)
   - Renamed `bdchmElement` → `maps_to` in VariableSpec DTO
   - Updated dataLoader field mapping
   - Updated all references in Element classes and tests

**Results**:
- ✅ TypeScript typecheck passes
- ✅ All dataLoader tests pass (9/9)
- ✅ Variable relationship tests pass
- ✅ No UI changes required (backward compatible)
- ✅ Infrastructure ready for Stage 2

**Commits**:
- `9c27b0b` - Stage 1 Step 2: Define edge-based interfaces for Slots-as-Edges
- `ff9d2a5` - Stage 1 Step 3: Add stub DataService methods for edge-based model
- `d2f4a0d` - Stage 1 Step 4: Rename variable field bdchmElement → maps_to

**Detailed documentation**: See PROGRESS.md Phase 16

### Stage 2: Import and Model Types

**Goal**: Add TypeElement and Range abstraction

**Steps**:
1. ✅ **Define DataService and model interfaces** (addresses graphology+OOP question above)
   - Sketch what queries DataService needs to make
   - Determine if we need property-based filtering in graph queries
   - Decide: Graph stores IDs only (Option A), all properties (Option B), or hybrid (Option C)
   - Document interface contracts before implementation
2. ✅ Download linkml:types during data fetch
3. ✅ Parse types in dataLoader.ts
4. ✅ Create TypeElement class extending Range base class
5. ✅ Create Range abstract base class/interface
6. ✅ Make ClassElement, EnumElement extend Range
7. ✅ Add TypeCollection (rethink collections approach with graphology)

**Status**: ✅ **Stage 2 Complete!** All steps (1-7) finished.

**Implementation Notes**:
- categorizeRange() treats types as 'primitive' (leaf nodes like string/integer)
- Types don't create relationship links (getRelationships returns empty array)
- DataService automatically handles types through generic collection interface

**Open question**: Do we need collections at all with graph model, or just for getLabel/getDefaultExpansion?
- Answer deferred to Stage 3 - will evaluate during graphology integration

**Files**:
- `scripts/download_source_data.py` - Download linkml:types
- `src/utils/dataLoader.ts` - Parse types, create SlotEdge instances instead of ClassSlot
- `src/types.ts` - Add Type DTO, SlotEdge interface
- `src/models/Element.ts` - Add Range abstract base class, TypeElement class
- `src/models/ElementCollection.ts` - Add TypeCollection, simplify with graphology

### Stage 3: Refactor to Graph Model with SlotEdges

**Goal**: Replace current Element-based model with graph-based model using graphology

**Key insight**: A vast amount of what happens in current Element.ts can be handled by graphology queries

**Steps**:
1. Install and configure graphology
2. Define graph structure:
   - Node types: Class, Enum, Slot, Type, Variable
   - Edge types: SlotEdge, InheritanceEdge, MapsToEdge
3. Create SlotEdge class/interface:
   - Properties: name, slotRef, required, multivalued, inherited_from, overrides
   - Connects Class → Range with context-specific properties
4. Refactor ClassElement to use SlotEdges instead of ClassSlots
5. Update getRelationships() implementations:
   - Current: Returns direct property links (hiding slots), includes inheritance as 'inherits' type
   - New: Returns slot edges
   - Should make hover/link logic simpler
6. Remove/refactor ClassSlot class
7. Simplify collections:
   - Keep for getLabel, getDefaultExpansion
   - Replace methods like getUsedByClasses with graphology queries

**Files**:
- `src/models/Element.ts` - SlotEdge class, refactor ClassElement, Range abstraction
- `src/models/ElementCollection.ts` - Simplify with graphology queries
- `src/services/DataService.ts` - Add type collection, update relationship APIs, add getSlotEdgesForClass()

### Stage 4: UI Layout Changes

**Goal**: Implement three-panel layout with middle slot panel

**Strategy**: Refactor LinkOverlay while keeping middle panel closed. Once in good shape, enable middle panel. May become two link overlays: left-middle, middle-right.

**Steps**:
1. Add middle panel to App.tsx:
   - Panel state management (visible/hidden)
   - URL state format (add middle panel to sections)
2. Update Panel.tsx for middle panel toggle support
3. Update statePersistence.ts for middle panel URL state
4. Refactor Section.tsx:
   - Ranges section rendering (Classes/Enums/Types)
   - Separate sections with "Ranges: [C] [E] [T]" heading
5. Update SectionItem.tsx if needed for range items
6. Refactor LinkOverlay.tsx:
   - Traverse Class → SlotEdge → Range
   - See TASKS.md "LinkOverlay Refactor" task
   - When middle panel visible: render two-step links (class→slot, slot→range)

**Files**:
- `src/App.tsx` - 3-panel layout, middle panel state management
- `src/components/Panel.tsx` - Middle panel toggle support
- `src/components/Section.tsx` - Ranges section rendering
- `src/components/SectionItem.tsx` - Range item updates if needed
- `src/utils/statePersistence.ts` - URL state for middle panel
- `src/components/LinkOverlay.tsx` - Slot edge traversal

### Stage 5: Detail Box Updates

**Goal**: Render slots with clickable ranges in detail boxes

**Steps**:
1. Update DetailPanel to render slot edges:
   - Show slots with clickable/hoverable ranges
   - Display slot metadata (required, multivalued, inherited_from)
2. Update RelationshipInfoBox to display slot edge properties

**Files**:
- `src/components/DetailPanel.tsx` - Render slot edges with clickable ranges
- `src/components/RelationshipInfoBox.tsx` - Display slot edge properties

### Stage 6: Documentation Updates

**Goal**: Update documentation to reflect new architecture

**Files**:
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` - Add Range abstraction, SlotEdge pattern, graph model approach
- `docs/DATA_FLOW.md` - Update with Slots-as-Edges architecture and graphology usage
- `docs/TASKS.md` - Update active tasks, remove obsolete items
- `docs/PROGRESS.md` - Archive this refactor as Phase 15
