## 🎯 Target release: 2026-07-30

Need to work backwards from this date to set intermediate deadlines for requesting,
receiving, and implementing stakeholder feedback.

---

## 🚀 Progressive-Disclosure Refactor (TOP PRIORITY)

New UX direction captured in the [tabular drilldown mockup](../public/tabular-drilldown-mockup.html)
(deployed at https://sigfried.github.io/dynamic-model-var-docs/tabular-drilldown-mockup.html)
and feedback document. The current "kitchen sink" layout is overwhelming; this refactor
replaces the default view with a categorized entity list that progressively reveals
slots, variables, enum detail, and class detail inline. See
[temp-but-share-for-now/STAKEHOLDER_QUESTIONS.md](../temp-but-share-for-now/STAKEHOLDER_QUESTIONS.md)
for the broader direction.

**Dependency note:** once the Variable Library is live, the variable-drilldown portion
of the refactor can be simplified — no need for deep variable views inside the entity
explorer.

### Subtasks (rough order)

1. **Finalize UX direction** — mockup review, stakeholder sign-off, decide primary
   audience (non-technical vs. technical vs. both-via-progressive-disclosure).
2. **Has-a hierarchy — try it.** ⚠️ IN PROGRESS. Built two exploratory mockups:
   - [Containment tree](../public/containment-tree-mockup.html) — interactive indented
     list rooted at ResearchStudyCollection. FK-direction edges inverted for containment
     view; is-a subclasses nested inline (own slots only, no inherited duplication).
   - [Containment graph](../public/has-a-mockup.html) — Cytoscape + dagre node-link
     diagram from the same containment data (49 nodes, 95 edges). Three edge types:
     has-a, flipped FK, and is-a subclass.
   - Key finding: BDCHM uses FK-style back-references (child points to parent), so
     most edges need inversion for a containment view. A heuristic (flip single-valued
     slots to entities; keep multi-valued and value-object slots) plus a small override
     list gets this ~90% right.
   - Scripts: `scripts/extract_containment_tree.py`, `scripts/extract_has_a_graph.py`.
   - **Still TODO**: evaluate the "pin a set of entities → generate filtered diagram"
     idea. The whole-model graph is borderline legible; a pin-subset view may be the
     more useful deliverable. Also: discuss FK-inversion heuristic with model designer
     to validate edge-direction decisions.
3. **Categorized entity list** — top-level Pinned section plus semantic categories
   (Admin/Study, Clinical, Lab/Biospecimen, etc.). Collapsible; only Pinned expanded by
   default.
4. **Default pinning** — Demography, Condition, MeasurementObservation. Pin state
   persisted in URL / localStorage.
5. **Inline slot drilldown** — Slots and Variables tabs, inherited and overridden tags,
   range-type badges.
6. **Inline enum-range detail card** — permissible values including CURIE labels and
   definitions (not just CURIE identifiers), "used by" links, inherits / reachable_from
   sections. Benefits from already-done EnumInput work (see Unused Schema Fields
   workspace below).
7. **Inline class-range detail card** — "Referenced by" list above the slot summary,
   "Go to entity" link for navigation.
8. **Non-LinkML terminology with LinkML-term tooltips**.
   - Default to general-audience terms: *property* (for slot), *value set* /
     *permissible values* (for enum), *property type* (for range), etc.
   - Show LinkML equivalents in tooltips or a secondary label, OR provide a user
     setting to toggle between "general" and "LinkML" vocabularies.
   - Link to LinkML docs from tooltips.
9. **URL state encoding** — deep-linking and working browser back button. Current app
   encodes some state in the URL but the back button is reportedly buggy; investigate
   root cause. Key states to encode: expanded entity, drilldown tab (slots / vars),
   open inline card.
10. **Release checklist** for 2026-07-30 (QA, deploy path, feedback loop, etc.).

## 📋 Upcoming Work (Ordered by Priority)

### Render markdown in schema fields
- e.g., `UnitOfMeasurementEnum.description` contains markdown but is rendered as plain
  text in detail views.
- **Feeds the refactor**: needed for the inline enum detail card (Example 4 in the
  mockup).

### Slot names in class detail Slots table should be linked
- Should behave like other element refs (hover + click navigation).
- **Feeds the refactor**: needed for the inline class detail card (Example 5 in the
  mockup).

### Incorporate Unused Schema Fields into UI
- Enum inheritance and other fields
    - LinkML enums use `inherits` field (not `is_a` like classes)
    - Currently dataLoader/Element ignores enum `inherits` and other fields
    - Need to audit EnumInput for all fields and surface in UI
- Check console for "Unexpected fields" warnings. Currently seeing:
  ```
    dataLoader.ts:97 Unexpected fields in processed JSON (not yet used in UI):
        dataLoader.ts:100   SlotInput: alias, comments, designates_type, domain_of, examples, from_schema, global, inlined, inlined_as_list, overrides, owner, unit, values_from
        dataLoader.ts:100   EnumInput: comments, include, inherits, parent, reachable_from, see_also
        dataLoader.ts:100   TypeInput: exact_mappings_urls
        dataLoader.ts:100   ClassInput: class_url
  ```
- Add to UI or document why ignored
- For each field:
  - Show me some examples and give me stats (e.g., x of y SlotInputs have alias. example1, example 2...)
  - I decide if we add / ignore / deal with later
  - For add and ignore, add to expected fields; make clear which are ignored
  - For add, document plans for incorporating 
#### Unused Schema Fields Workspace

check claude's work:

      SlotInput fields:
      - ✅ comments - shown under description as "Comments:"
      - ✅ examples - shown under description as "Examples: value1, value2..."
      - ✅ inlined / inlinedAsList - shown as properties when true
      - ✅ domain_of / owner - investigated and marked as IGNORE (domain_of misses inherited slots)

      EnumInput fields:
      - ✅ comments - shown under description
      - ✅ inherits - new section "Inherits Values From" with clickable enum links
      - ✅ reachable_from - new section "Reachable From (Dynamic Values)" with source ontology, nodes, etc.

      Still TODO (marked as LATER):
      - unit - ask team
      - include, parent, see_also for enums

      Files changed:
      - src/models/SchemaTypes.ts - added new field types
      - src/input_types.ts - added input field definitions
      - src/utils/dataLoader.ts - transform functions
      - src/models/Element.ts - SlotElement and EnumElement classes
      - docs/TASKS.md - updated workspace with completion status

### ⚠️ WIP: Class-specific slot definitions (Dec 15, 2025) - INCOMPLETE

**Problem reported**: DrugExposure's `quantity` slot showed Procedure's description ("The quantity of procedures ordered or administered.") instead of the drug-specific description.

**Root cause**: When multiple classes define the same slot name with different descriptions (e.g., Procedure, DrugExposure, DeviceExposure all define `quantity`), transform_schema.py was using the first definition and ignoring the rest.

**Instructions given**:
1. User showed screenshot of wrong description
2. Asked to fix so DrugExposure shows its own quantity description
3. Suggested adding `name` field to slot references in bdchm.processed.json to simplify UI code

**Changes attempted** (NOT WORKING - still shows wrong names in UI):
1. `scripts/transform_schema.py`:
   - Added `find_conflicting_slot_definitions()` to detect slots with different definitions across classes
   - Modified `transform_classes()` to create class-specific slot IDs (e.g., `quantity-DrugExposure`)
   - Modified `transform_slots()` to create class-specific slot instances
   - Added `name` field to slot references when ID differs from display name

2. `src/models/SchemaTypes.ts`:
   - Added `name?: string` to SlotReference interface

3. `src/models/Element.ts`:
   - Updated ClassElement.getDetailData() to use `slotRef.name || slot.name` for display

4. `src/components/DetailContent.tsx`:
   - Added `renderMarkdown()` function for table cell content
   - Updated `renderCell()` to render markdown in all string cells

5. `public/source_data/HM/bdchm.processed.json`:
   - Regenerated with class-specific slots

**Status**: UI still shows `quantity-DrugExposure` instead of `quantity`. The `slotRef.name` change is not being picked up. Needs debugging - possibly the dataLoader transform is not reading the `name` field from slot references.

### LinkOverlay fixes (lower priority — may be superseded by inline cards)
- Edge labels: show on hover; tooltip display needs improvement.
- Note: the progressive-disclosure refactor's inline entity-summary cards and
  "Referenced by" lists may replace most of what links currently communicate. Revisit
  priority after the refactor's direction is finalized.

---

## 📚 Larger Refactoring Tasks

### Abstract Tree Rendering System
- Extract tree rendering and expansion logic from Element
- Enables consistent tree UX across Elements panel and info boxes
- See [detailed plan](#abstract-tree) below

### Reduce Element subclass code
- Most behavior should move to graph queries
- Element classes become thinner wrappers around graph data
- **Blocked by**: Abstract Tree system
- See [detailed plan](#reduce-element-subclass-code-details) below

### Grouped Slots Panel
- Display slots grouped by Global + per-class sections
- Show inheritance (inherited vs defined here vs overridden)
- Visual indicators for slot origin
- **Uses**: Abstract Tree system for rendering
- ⚠️ **Possibly obsolete if progressive-disclosure refactor ships** — slot grouping
  moves into the inline per-entity drilldown. Keep here pending decision.

---

## 🔧 Medium Priority

### Overhaul Badge Display System
- Show multiple counts per element (e.g., "103 vars, 5 enums, 2 slots")
- Add labels or tooltips to clarify what counts mean
- ⚠️ **Partially obsoleted by progressive-disclosure refactor** — the new entity table
  uses separate columns for Slots / Cls / Enm / Typ / Vars, which serves most of this
  need. Revisit after refactor.

### Detail Panel Enhancements
- Show reachable_from info for enums
- Show inheritance
- Slot order: Inherited slots at top

### Change "attribute" to "slot" terminology
- Throughout codebase

### Condition/DrugExposure Variable Display
- Show message that these are handled as records, not specific variables

---

## 🔮 Low Priority / Future Ideas

### Search and Filter
- Search: Important for exploring large schemas
- Filtering: Grouping provides a lot already

### LayoutManager rename
- No longer about "whitespace monitoring" - it's now MainLayout/AppLayout
- Consider renaming to better reflect current purpose

### Animation library
- Smooth animations for various interactions

### Initial render performance
- Chrome warning: `requestAnimationFrame handler took 75ms`
- Likely from element tree or link overlay calculations on page load

### Viewport culling for links
- Don't show links when both endpoints off screen

### Responsive panel widths
- Currently fixed: MAX_PANEL_WIDTH=450px, EMPTY_PANEL_WIDTH=180px

### Relationship Info Box - Keyboard navigation

### Neighborhood Zoom + Feature Parity with Official Docs
- See archived REFACTOR_PLAN for full details

---

## 📝 Detailed Plans

<a id="abstract-tree"></a>
### Abstract Tree Rendering System - Details

**Goal**: Extract tree rendering and expansion logic from Element into reusable abstractions.

**Current state**:
- Element class has tree capabilities (parent, children, traverse, ancestorList)
- Expansion state managed by useExpansionState hook
- Tree rendering handled in each component

**Proposed abstraction**:
- Create parent class or mixin with tree capabilities
- Element becomes a child of this abstraction
- Info box data structures as tree nodes
- Shared rendering components/hooks

[sg] i'm not sure when this was written, but it's not how i was thinking about
     it. the abstract tree is for rendering -- it's in the UI so it probably
     shouldn't be (closely) tied to Element. need to discuss before implementing

**Key insight**: All presentation data should be tree-shaped.

**Methods to extract from Element:**
- `toRenderableItems()` - tree → flat list with expansion
- `toSectionItems()` - tree → SectionItemData list
- `getSectionItemData()` - single element → SectionItemData
- `ancestorList()` - walk up parent chain
- `traverse()` - depth-first traversal

<a id="reduce-element-subclass-code-details"></a>
### Reduce Element Subclass Code - Details

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Simplify `getDetailData()` via tree abstraction (BLOCKED: needs Abstract Tree)
2. Move tree methods to Abstract Tree system
3. Consolidate flat collections (Enum, Type, Slot)
4. Simplify Element subclass constructors
5. Graph as primary for relationship queries (partially done)
6. Fix remaining "DTO" terminology in codebase

**Target state:**
- Element subclasses: ~30-50 lines each
- Presentation logic: components layer
- Tree logic: Abstract Tree system
- Relationship queries: Graph module

## 🧹 Documentation & Technical Debt

### Implement devError() utility
- Throws in development, logs quietly in production
- Replace silent `return null` patterns
