Also, since these identifiers are created outside the information system through a specific business process, the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional metadata so the actual identifier values are qualified by the context that created those values. This additional context allows \"identifier\" instances to be transmitted as business data across systems while still being able to trace them back to the system of origin.",
