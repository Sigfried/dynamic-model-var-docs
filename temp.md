## COMPLETED: Element Collection Refactor (2025-01-27)

**All Done:**
- ✅ Created EnumCollection and SlotCollection classes in Element.tsx
- ✅ Created ClassCollection with state persistence (lce/rce keys)
- ✅ Created VariableCollection with state persistence (lve/rve keys)
- ✅ Generic Section component replaces all type-specific sections
- ✅ dataLoader.ts creates all four collections
- ✅ Removed old section components (ClassSection, EnumSection, SlotSection, VariablesSection)
- ✅ Fixed variable expansion bug (left/right panels now use separate lve/rve keys)
- ✅ Hover highlighting implemented with helper function

**Git Tag**: `pre-element-collection-refactor` (safe rollback point before refactor)

## COMPLETED: slot_usage Bug Fix (2025-01-27)

**Fixed class slot display to properly handle LinkML inheritance:**
- ✅ Shows inherited slots from parent classes
- ✅ Shows referenced top-level slots
- ✅ Applies slot_usage refinements (e.g., narrowing range, making required)
- ✅ Added Source column showing: Inline / Slot: {name} / ← {ParentClass}
- ✅ Added ⚡ indicator for refined slots
- ✅ Links now point to refined types (e.g., MeasurementObservation not Observation)

**Example**: MeasurementObservationSet now correctly shows:
- `observations` slot with range `MeasurementObservation` (not `Observation`)
- Source: `← ObservationSet`
- ⚡ indicating slot_usage refinement applied

## COMPLETED: Terminology Cleanup (2025-01-27)

**Done:**
- ✅ Renamed `entity` → `element` throughout codebase (avoiding confusion with Entity model class)
  - Updated all components, utilities, and tests
  - Kept 'Entity' (capitalized) references to BDCHM model class intact
  - Removed obsolete ClassSection.test.tsx
  - All 130 tests passing, type checking passes

**Next:**
- Consider the CRITICAL refactoring tasks below

## CRITICAL: Further Background Refactoring Needed

### Problem: Element-Type-Specific Code Scattered Everywhere

**Current issues:**
- References to `class|enum|slot|variable` all over the codebase
- References to `enumCollection|slotCollection` and other type-specific things
- App.tsx has gotten way too long
- types.ts has definitions that should be in model classes
- PropertyDefinition should be in Slot class (or Class for now)
- Relationship type and targetType values need centralization
- Making MORE type-specific code even while refactoring

### Goal: DRY Everything Into the Model Layer

**Why**: This app is getting pretty good. Element types may change, but might also want to use it for **completely different model navigation apps**. Need to make it reusable.

**Strategy**: Sequester as much element-type-specific logic as possible to Element.tsx and subclasses

### Specific Refactoring Tasks

#### 1. Move Types from types.ts to Model Classes
- `PropertyDefinition` → belongs in Slot class (conceptually) or Class (for now)
- `Relationship` → belongs in Element base class
- `Relationship.type` and `Relationship.targetType` → should get values from central registry
- Review what's still useful in types.ts, move to appropriate model classes

#### 2. Consider Splitting Element.tsx
- File is getting large with 4 subclasses + collections
- Options:
  - `models/elements/Element.ts` (base)
  - `models/elements/ClassElement.ts`
  - `models/elements/EnumElement.ts`
  - `models/elements/SlotElement.ts`
  - `models/elements/VariableElement.ts`
  - `models/collections/ElementCollection.ts` (base)
  - `models/collections/ClassCollection.ts`
  - etc.

#### 3. Centralize Element Type Registry
Create a central place for element type metadata instead of hardcoding strings everywhere:

```typescript
// models/ElementRegistry.ts
export const ELEMENT_TYPES = {
  CLASS: { id: 'class', label: 'C', color: 'blue', ... },
  ENUM: { id: 'enum', label: 'E', color: 'purple', ... },
  SLOT: { id: 'slot', label: 'S', color: 'green', ... },
  VARIABLE: { id: 'variable', label: 'V', color: 'orange', ... }
} as const;
```

Then reference it everywhere instead of hardcoding.

#### 4. Refactor App.tsx
- Too long (600+ lines)
- Extract logic into:
  - `hooks/useModelData.ts` - data loading
  - `hooks/useDialogState.ts` - dialog management
  - `hooks/useLayoutState.ts` - panel layout persistence
  - Keep App.tsx focused on composition

#### 5. Make Collection Interface More Generic
The app should work with **any** set of ElementCollections, not just the 4 we have now:

```typescript
// Instead of:
collections: { enums: EnumCollection; slots: SlotCollection; }

// More generic:
collections: ElementCollection[]

// Or:
collections: Map<string, ElementCollection>
```

Then components iterate over collections without knowing types.

## Additional Issues to Address (Lower Priority)

### External Link Integration
- Link prefixed IDs to external sites (OMOP, DUO, etc.)
- Use prefix data from bdchm.yaml

### Feature Parity with Official Docs
Reference: https://rtiinternational.github.io/NHLBI-BDC-DMC-HM/

1. **Types** - Import and display linkml:types
2. **Dynamic enums** - Show which enums are dynamic
3. **LinkML Source** - Collapsible raw LinkML view
4. **Direct and Induced** - Show direct vs inherited slots
5. **Partial ERDs** - Visual relationship diagrams

### GitHub Issue Management
Issue: https://github.com/RTIInternational/NHLBI-BDC-DMC-HM/issues/126
- Make issue more concise
- Add subissues for specific features (ASK FIRST)
