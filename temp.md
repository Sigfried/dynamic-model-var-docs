## Current Status: Phase 3d - SVG Link Visualization (In Progress)

### ✅ Completed This Session

**Testing Infrastructure Setup**
- Installed Vitest, React Testing Library, @testing-library/jest-dom
- Created test setup with mocked `fetch` for file system access
- All 67 tests passing ✅

**Test Suite Created**
1. `data-integrity.test.ts` - Data completeness reporting (tracks YAML → JSON → ModelData pipeline)
2. `dataLoader.test.ts` - Core data loading logic
3. `ClassSection.test.tsx` - Component rendering tests
4. `linkLogic.test.ts` - Element relationship detection (26 tests)
5. `linkHelpers.test.ts` - SVG link utilities (27 tests)

**Production Code (TDD)**
- `src/utils/linkHelpers.ts` - Fully tested link utilities
  - Relationship filtering functions
  - Link building from relationships
  - Geometric calculations (centers, anchor points, edge detection)
  - SVG path generation (bezier curves, self-ref loops)
  - Visual styling (colors, stroke widths)

**Element Architecture**
- All Element classes (`ClassElement`, `EnumElement`, `SlotElement`, `VariableElement`) have working `getRelationships()` methods
- Data attributes (`data-element-type`, `data-element-name`) in place for SVG positioning

## Next Session: Complete Phase 3d

### Step 4: Create LinkOverlay Component

**Goal**: Visual implementation using the tested logic layer

**Tasks**:
1. Create `src/components/LinkOverlay.tsx`
   - Accepts visible elements from parent
   - Queries DOM for element positions via data attributes
   - Calls `element.getRelationships()` for each visible element
   - Uses `linkHelpers` to filter and build link objects
   - Renders SVG with paths, using helper functions for positioning/styling

2. Wire up to PanelLayout
   - Add LinkOverlay as absolute-positioned layer over panels
   - Pass visible element data from App state
   - Initially render all links (no filtering UI)

3. Visual verification
   - Check inheritance links (blue, thick)
   - Check enum property links (purple, medium)
   - Check class property links (green, medium)
   - Check self-referential links (loop style)

### Step 5: Add Interactions & Controls

**Tasks**:
1. Filter controls (checkboxes/toggles):
   - Show/hide inheritance
   - Show/hide properties
   - Show/hide enums only
   - Show/hide class refs only
   - Include self-refs (default: off)

2. Hover interactions:
   - Highlight link on hover (increase opacity/stroke width)
   - Show tooltip with relationship info

3. Click interactions:
   - Navigate to target element (open dialog)

4. Performance:
   - Only render links for elements in viewport
   - Debounce scroll/resize events
   - Consider using React.memo for link components

## Testing Philosophy Applied This Session

**What we tested (TDD)**:
- ✅ Pure functions for filtering, calculations, path generation
- ✅ Relationship detection logic in Element classes
- ✅ All geometric calculations for link positioning

**What we'll verify visually (next session)**:
- SVG rendering aesthetics (curve smoothness, colors)
- Layout and positioning (are links connecting correctly?)
- Animations and hover effects
- Performance with many links

**Lessons learned**:
- TDD works great for logic layers
- Separating testable logic from visual components is key
- Visual features still need manual verification, but tested logic gives confidence
- Having 67 passing tests makes refactoring safe

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run tests
npm test              # Watch mode
npm test -- --run     # Single run

# Run specific test file
npm test -- linkHelpers --run

# Dev server
npm run dev

# Type check
npm run build
```

## Notes for README.md (Move Later)

The testing documentation in CLAUDE.md (lines 231-314) should eventually move to README.md with:
- Overview of test philosophy
- How to run tests
- What's tested vs. visually verified
- How to add new tests

Keep it concise in README, detailed in CLAUDE.md for development context.
