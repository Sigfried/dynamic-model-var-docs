## ✅ Completed: Session 1 - Test Suite Expansion for Phase 3e

**Date**: 2025-01-22

**Summary**: Successfully extracted Phase 3e logic into testable utility functions and created comprehensive test coverage (67 new tests added, bringing total from 67 to 134).

### What Was Done

1. **Created utility files**:
   - `src/utils/layoutHelpers.ts` - Space calculation and display mode determination
   - `src/utils/duplicateDetection.ts` - Entity duplicate detection logic
   - `src/utils/panelHelpers.tsx` - Panel title and header color utilities

2. **Created test files** (67 new tests):
   - `src/test/adaptiveLayout.test.ts` (23 tests) - Space calculation and mode switching
   - `src/test/duplicateDetection.test.ts` (28 tests) - Duplicate entity detection
   - `src/test/panelHelpers.test.tsx` (16 tests) - Panel title generation and color selection

3. **Refactored components**:
   - `src/App.tsx` - Uses new utilities for space calculation and duplicate detection
   - `src/components/DetailPanelStack.tsx` - Uses new utilities for panel titles and colors

**Test Results**: All 134 tests passing ✅

## Next: Phase 4 - Search and Filter

**Status**: Ready to begin

**Goal**: Add full-text search and filtering capabilities to help users quickly find and navigate to specific entities.

### Features to Implement

1. **Search Bar**
   - Full-text search across all entities (classes, enums, slots, variables)
   - Search by name, description, or other text fields
   - Real-time filtering as user types
   - Search results displayed in dropdown or dedicated results panel

2. **Search Results Display**
   - Show entity type (class/enum/slot/variable) with each result
   - Highlight matching text
   - Group results by entity type
   - Click result to open in detail dialog or stacked panel

3. **Filters**
   - Faceted filtering by entity type (checkboxes)
   - Variable count slider (for classes)
   - Relationship type filters (has enum properties, has class references, etc.)
   - Abstract vs concrete classes
   - Clear all filters button

4. **UI Placement**
   - Search bar in header (always visible)
   - Filter controls in collapsible sidebar or dropdown
   - Integrate with existing panel system
   - Don't interfere with current layout

### Implementation Approach

**TDD where possible**:
- Search logic (text matching, filtering) → pure functions → tested
- Result ranking/sorting → testable
- Filter combination logic → testable

**Visual verification**:
- Search UI layout and styling
- Dropdown/results panel appearance
- Highlight animation

### Technical Considerations

- Use existing data structures (classes, enums, slots, variables already loaded)
- Build search index for performance (if needed)
- Debounce search input (300ms)
- Consider fuzzy matching (optional enhancement)
- Keyboard navigation for search results (arrow keys, enter)

### Success Criteria

- User can search for any entity by name
- Search results are relevant and ranked appropriately
- Clicking result opens detail view
- Filters work independently and in combination
- Search performance is fast (< 100ms for typical queries)
- All search/filter logic has test coverage
