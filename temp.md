## Current Status: Phase 3d - SVG Link Visualization (✅ Complete)

### ✅ Completed This Session

**Phase 3d: Visual Implementation Complete**
- Created `src/components/LinkOverlay.tsx` with full SVG link rendering
- Fixed critical infinite render loop bug (memoized panel data in App.tsx)
- Fixed missing sections bug (removed grid layout, sections now stack vertically)
- Improved link visibility (opacity 0.2 → 1.0 on hover, stroke width increases)
- Made panels narrower (max-width: 450px instead of flex: 1)
- Documented feature request: show enum/slot/class counts

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Links only show between left ↔ right panels (cross-panel filtering)
- Inheritance links disabled (tree structure already shows this)
- Hover: opacity 20% → 100%, stroke width increases to 3px
- Link colors: purple (enum), green (class), blue (inheritance - disabled)
- Self-referential links use loop style

**Bug Fixes**:
1. **Infinite render loop**: Memoized `leftPanelData` and `rightPanelData` in App.tsx
2. **Missing sections**: Removed grid layout, changed to `flex flex-col` with `flex-1 min-h-0` on each section
3. **Hover not working**: Added `pointerEvents: 'stroke'` to SVG paths
4. **Panel width**: Changed from `flex: 1` to `max-width: 450px, min-width: 300px`

**All 67 tests still passing ✅**

## Next Steps: Future Enhancements

### Immediate Opportunities (Low-hanging fruit)
1. **Click-to-navigate on links**: Add onClick handler to open target dialog
2. **Link tooltips**: Show relationship details on hover
3. **Filter controls UI**: Toggles for link types (inheritance/properties/enums/classes)

### Medium Priority
4. **Enhanced element metadata**: Show enum/slot/class counts (see CLAUDE.md § Future: Enhanced Element Metadata Display)
5. **Viewport culling**: Only render links for visible elements (performance)
6. **Custom preset management**: User-saved layout configurations

### Long-term (Phase 4+)
7. **Search and filter**: Full-text search across all elements
8. **Neighborhood zoom**: Show k-hop relationships around selected element
9. **Advanced visualizations**: Network view, matrix view, statistics dashboard

## Session Summary

**Phase 3d complete!** The SVG link visualization is now fully functional with:
- Cross-panel links rendering correctly
- Improved hover interactions
- Narrower, more readable panel layout
- All critical bugs fixed
- 67 tests still passing

The app is now at a good milestone - users can explore the BDCHM model with visual links showing relationships between elements in different panels.
